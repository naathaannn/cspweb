                            In AP Computer Science Principles, the "Introducing the Internet" unit examines the foundational concepts that enable global connectivity. Students explore how diverse networks connect through routers, switches, and gateways to form the Internet, and they study how data is transmitted using concepts like bit rate, bandwidth, and packet switching. The unit also covers Internet addressing protocols—including IPv4 and IPv6—that uniquely identify devices, as well as routing protocols that use redundancy and fault tolerance to ensure reliable data delivery. Furthermore, it delves into the layered architecture of the Internet protocol suite, the importance of open protocol development for interoperability, and the societal implications of the digital divide.

                            <li><strong>Connecting Networks</strong>: Understand how physical and virtual networks interconnect using routers, switches, and gateways to create the global network infrastructure.</li>
                            <li><strong>Bit Rate and Bandwidth</strong>: Explore how data transfer rates (bit rate) and channel capacity (bandwidth) influence network performance and efficiency.</li>
                            <li><strong>Addressing the Internet</strong>: Learn about IP addressing schemes (IPv4 and IPv6) that assign unique identifiers to devices, facilitating effective communication and routing.</li>
                            <li><strong>Routing with Redundancy</strong>: Analyze routing protocols that incorporate redundancy and fault tolerance to maintain reliable data transmission even when parts of the network fail.</li>
                            <li><strong>Transporting Packets</strong>: Delve into packet switching, where data is broken into packets that travel over different routes and are reassembled at the destination for efficient transmission.</li>
                            <li><strong>Web Protocols</strong>: Understand protocols such as HTTP and HTTPS, which enable secure and reliable communication between web clients and servers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Scalable Systems</strong>: Examine how network systems are designed to scale, accommodating growing numbers of users and increasing data loads without compromising performance.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Internet Protocol Suite</strong>: Study the layered model of the Internet, where each layer (from physical transmission to application-level services) plays a specific role in managing data flow.</li>
                            <li><strong>Open Protocol Development</strong>: Recognize the importance of open standards in protocol development, which foster innovation, interoperability, and global connectivity.</li>
                            <li><strong>The Digital Divide</strong>: Investigate the societal impacts of unequal access to digital resources, highlighting challenges and considerations in achieving universal connectivity.</li>
