                            In AP Computer Science Principles, the Cybersecurity unit focuses on safeguarding data and devices by understanding the mechanisms behind online data security. This unit covers the importance of protecting personal identifiable information (PII), tracking how user data is monitored, and recognizing various cyber attacks. Students learn about vulnerabilities exploited through phishing, rogue access points, and malware, while also exploring defensive measures such as data encryption, secure Internet protocols, digital certificates, and robust user authentication methods. The unit emphasizes the balance between functionality and privacy, providing insight into geolocation tracking and user history, and highlighting the ethical responsibilities inherent in managing digital information.
