                            In AP Computer Science Principles, programming is the art and science of creating instructions that a computer follows to perform tasks. It involves developing algorithms, writing code, and using computational thinking to solve problems. In this context, programming not only teaches you how to construct logic through conditionals, loops, and procedures, but also how to manage data using variables, mathematical expressions, strings, and lists. The curriculum emphasizes abstraction, iteration, and modularity—key concepts that allow you to break down complex problems into simpler parts and write reusable, efficient code.

                            <li><strong>Programming Basics</strong>: Learn the fundamentals of coding, including syntax and logic, and understand how algorithms are translated into executable instructions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Variables</strong>: Explore how to declare and manipulate variables as named storage for data, which is essential for tracking information throughout a program.</li>
                            <li><strong>Math and Strings</strong>: Use mathematical expressions to perform calculations and apply string operations to process and manipulate textual data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Conditionals</strong>: Control the flow of a program with if, else, and nested conditionals, using Boolean expressions and logical operators to make decisions based on dynamic conditions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Procedures</strong>: Develop procedures (or functions) to encapsulate reusable blocks of code, often with parameters and return values, which promote modular design and abstraction.</li>
                            <li><strong>Repetition</strong>: Implement loops such as for-loops and while-loops to execute a set of instructions multiple times, which is critical for automating repetitive tasks and iterating over data structures.</li>
                            <li><strong>Lists</strong>: Manage collections of data using lists, and practice iterating over these data structures to perform operations on each element, reinforcing concepts of organization and data manipulation.</li>
